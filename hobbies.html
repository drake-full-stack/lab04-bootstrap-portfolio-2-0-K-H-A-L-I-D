        <h2>My Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        
        <section>
            <h3>Gaming & Competition</h3>
            <p>Gaming has been a huge part of my life! I love the strategy and quick thinking required in competitive games, 
            plus the problem-solving aspects of RPGs. There's something about mastering complex systems that appeals to 
            the same part of my brain that loves programming.</p>

                <figcaption>Definitely not my setup but thought it looks cool</figcaption>

            <h4>Current Favorites:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>FPS Games:</strong> Fortnite (my main), Call of Duty, Valorant, Apex Legends</li>
                <li><strong>RPGs & Fantasy:</strong> Elden Ring, Elder Scrolls series, Sekiro, Expedition 33, or any souls-like game (Would take up a lot of pages if I were to list all the games I played lol)</li>
                <li><strong>What I Love:</strong> The strategic thinking in competitive games and the world-building in RPGs</li>
                <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I think Souls-like games actually improved my debugging skills by challenging my patience and persistence!</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>Soccer & Athletics</h3>
            <p><strong>Soccer is my main physical outlet!</strong> I love the teamwork and strategy involved, plus it's a 
            great way to stay active between all the screen time from coding and gaming.</p>

            </blockquote>
            
            <h4>My Soccer Experience:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Playing pickup games with friends on campus</li>
                <li>Following Premier League and international tournaments</li>
                <li>Trying to get better at free kicks (still working on it!)</li>
                <li>Watching tactical analysis videos since the strategy side fascinates me</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Cybersecurity & CTF Challenges</h3>
            <p>I got into cybersecurity through some friends at Drake, and now I'm totally hooked! We started a Cyber Club 
            last year and I love working through <em>Capture The Flag</em> challenges. There's something so satisfying about 
            finding vulnerabilities and figuring out how systems work under the hood.</p>

            <h4>Security Tools I Use:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Burp Suite for web application testing</li>
                <li>Wireshark for network analysis</li>
                <li>Metasploit for penetration testing practice</li>
                <li>Various Linux tools and Python scripting</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Our team actually placed 5th nationally in the ISEAGE CDC Hackathon last year, which was pretty incredible! 
            We were even invited to participate in the international competition that happened a few month after.</p>

            <h3>Music & Productivity</h3>
            <p>Music is essential for my coding sessions! I've discovered that different types of music work better 
            for different types of programming tasks.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus Mode:</strong> Lo-fi hip hop and ambient electronic</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Instrumental post-rock</li>
                    <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Surprisingly, upbeat pop music works best</li>
                    <li><strong>Late Night Coding:</strong> Synthwave and cyberpunk soundtracks</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>I also listen to a ton of tech podcasts during my commute to stay current with industry trends!</em></p>
